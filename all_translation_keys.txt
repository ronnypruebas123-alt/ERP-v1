Date on which the depreciation are supposed to be recalculated. This date should correspond to the last depreciation date (on the other software) + the depreciation period. (e.g. if on the other software the acquisition date is 01/07/2022, first depreciation was 31/12/2022 and already have been depreciated once, then the depreciation import date will be set to 31/12/2022 + 1 year thus the 31/12/2023). The first depreciation line will be generated according to this date.
